ðŸŒ¼ Animations: animation-fill-mode  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- This CSS property sets which values are applied before/after the animation. For example, you can set the last state of the animation to remain on screen (forwards), or you can set it to switch back to before when the animation began (backwards).

- `animation-fill-mode: none|forwards|backwards|both;`

ðŸŒ¼ Box-shadow  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

```css
box-shadow: (offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius(optional) | spread-radius(optional) | color(optional));
```

- `blur radius`: if set to 0 the shadow will be sharp, the higher the number, the more blurred it will be, and the further out the shadow will extend.
- `spread radius`: positive values increase the size of the shadow, negative values decrease the size. Default is 0 (the shadow is same size as blur).

```css
/* offset-x | offset-y | color */
box-shadow: 60px -16px teal;

/* offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | color */
box-shadow: 10px 5px 5px black;

/* offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | spread-radius | color */
box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);

/* inset | offset-x | offset-y | color */
box-shadow: inset 5em 1em gold;

/* Any number of shadows, separated by commas */
box-shadow: 3px 3px red, -1em 0 0.4em olive;
```

ðŸŒ¼ Box-sizing  
ðŸŒ¼ Cascading in CSS  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- Cascading is the process of combining several style sheets and resolving conflicts between them.
- The rule used is chosen by cascading down from the more general rules to the specific rule required.
- Concepts such as **inheritance** and **specificity** are used to decide which styles get applied.  

For instance,  

- a more specific rule will override a less specific rule.
- a rule defined in an external stylesheet is overruled by a style defined in the `<head>` of the document, which, in turn, is overruled by an inline style within the element itself.

ðŸŒ± Linear vs. Radial gradient  
ðŸŒ¼ list-style: none  
ðŸŒ¼ mix-blend-mode  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- The `mix-blend-mode` CSS property sets how an element's content should blend with the content of the element's parent and the element's background.

```css
mix-blend-mode: normal|multiply|screen|overlay|darken|lighten|color-dodge|color-burn|difference|exclusion|hue|saturation|color|luminosity;
```

An example:

```html
<style>
  .container {
    background-color: gold;
    padding: 15px;
  }

  .container img {
    mix-blend-mode: overlay;
  }
</style>

<div class="container">
  <img src="pineapple.jpg" alt="Pineapple" width="300" height="300">
</div>
```

ðŸŒ¼ Prefixes  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- CSS vendor prefixes, also sometimes known as or CSS browser prefixes, are a way for browser makers to add support for new CSS features before those features are fully supported in all browsers. This may be done during a sort of testing and experimentation period where the browser manufacturer is determining exactly how these new CSS features will be implemented. These prefixes became very popular with the rise of CSS3 a few years ago.
- The CSS browser prefixes that you can use (each of which is specific to a different browser) are:

```markdown
Android: -webkit-
Chrome: -webkit-
iOS: -webkit-
Safari: -webkit-
Firefox: -moz-
Internet Explorer: -ms-
Opera: -o-
```

```css
.container {
  -webkit-transition: all 4s ease;
  -moz-transition: all 4s ease;
  -ms-transition: all 4s ease;
  -o-transition: all 4s ease;
  transition: all 4s ease;
}
```

ðŸŒ± Pros and cons of translate() vs. position: absolute  
ðŸŒ¼ Pseudo-classes vs pseudo-elements  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>
- A pseudo-class is a selector that selects existing elements that are in a specific state, e.g. hovered over, checked, focused, etc.
- Pseudo-classes start with a colon `:`
- Some common pseudo-classes are `:active`, `:checked`, `:enabled`, `:first-child`, `:first-of-type`, `:focus`, `:hover`, `:last-child`, `:last-of-type`, `:nth-of-type`, `:visited`, etc.

```css
article a:hover {
    font-size: 120%;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

- Pseudo-elements behave in a similar way, however they act as if you had added a whole new HTML element into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements.
- Pseudo-elements start with a double colon `::`
- Most common pseudo-elements are `::after`, `::before`, `::first-letter`, and `::first-line`.

```css
article p::first-line {
    font-size: 120%;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```
