# Common Non-technical Interview Questions

Q. Tell me about yourself?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

This is usually considered an icebreaker question asked at the very beginning of an interview.

Keep your answer short and related to the position you are applying for. Remember that the interviewer is not your friend or therapist... yet.

Assume that the interviewer(s) have not looked at your resume or do not have it in front of them, so feel free to highlight any notable achievements or experiences or things that you are particularly proud of.

Q. Do you have any questions for us?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

This question is usually asked at the end of the interview. This is your opportunity to further show the interviewers your eagerness and passion for becoming part of the organization.

Avoid asking questions that have been already discussed or alluded to during the interview. Also consider the interviewer's role within the company. A person from HR may not be familiar with the tech stack used at the company or the VP of Engineering may not know the exact roles and responsibilities within your team. Lastly, it is advisable to avoid asking questions about pay, benefits, hours of work, break times, etc. These topics are usually more appropriate during the contract negotiation once the organization has expressed interest in offering you the role.

Some good questions to consider:
- What's your favorite thing about working here?
- How many other people are in my team? Any other juniors?
- What types of skills is the team missing that you're looking to fill with a new hire?
- What is the top priority for someone in this role?
- If I were hired for this role, what would you want me to achieve in my first couple of months?
- What are the biggest challenges that someone in this position would face at the beginning?
- Do you expect to hire more people in my team in the near future?

Q. Tell us about a time you had a conflict with a coworker or manager and how you dealt with it.

Q. If we called your previous employer/coworkers, what would they say about you?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

Think of specific examples that can back up your claims. For example, instead of saying "they would say that I have great attention to details", think of a specific situation or example where you displayed this quality in action.

Q. Where do you see yourself five years from now?

Again, rather than listing your strengths, can you come up with any actual examples from your past experiences where you showcased those strengths?

Q. What is your greatest weakness?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

Preferably stay away from cliche answers (e.g. I am a perfectionist) or things that are not really a weakness and have nothing to do with the role (e.g. I am not very good at ice skating).

Q. Why did you leave your last position?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
