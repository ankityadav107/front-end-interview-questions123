ğŸŒ¼ A/B testing  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- A/B testing (also known as split testing) is a process of showing two variants of the same web page to different segments of website visitors at the same time and comparing which variant drives more conversions.

ğŸŒ¼ A11y: ARIA  

<details><summary>Answer</summary><p>

- Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities.

The following gives no indication to assistive technologies that it is a custom checkbox:

```html
<li tabindex="0" class="checkbox" checked>
  Receive promotional offers
</li>
```

We can improve it by using the `role` and `aria-checked` attributes:

```html
<li tabindex="0" class="checkbox" role="checkbox" checked aria-checked="true">
  Receive promotional offers
</li>
```

ğŸŒ¼ API  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- An application programming interface (API) is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components.
- An API simplifies programming by abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs.

ğŸŒ¼ REST  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer.
- It is an architectural style that developers follow when they create their RESTful APIs.

ğŸŒ¼ RESTful API (6 constraints)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- In order to be a true RESTful API, a web service must adhere to the following six REST architectural constraints:
  
1. **Client-Server based**:  
The client and the server should be separate from each other and allowed to evolve individually and independently.
2. **Use of a uniform interface (UI)**:  
The key to the decoupling client from server is having a uniform interface that allows independent evolution of the application without having the applicationâ€™s services, models, or actions tightly coupled to the API layer itself. The uniform interface lets the client talk to the server in a single language, independent of the architectural backend of either.
3. **Stateless operations**:  
Meaning that requests can be made independently of one another, and each request contains all of the data necessary to complete itself successfully. A REST API should not rely on data being stored on the server or sessions to determine what to do with a request, but rather solely rely on the data that is provided in that request itself. Identifying information is not being stored on the server when making requests. Instead, each request has the necessary data in itself, such as the API key, access token, user ID, etc.
4. **Caching**:  
A REST API should be designed to encourage the storage of cacheable data on the client side in order to reduce the number of interactions with the API. This means that when data is cacheable, the response should indicate that the data can be stored up to a certain time (expires-at), or in cases where data needs to be real-time, that the response should not be cached by the client.
5. **Layered system**:  
REST allows for an architecture composed of multiple layers of servers. The requesting client need not know whether itâ€™s communicating with the actual server, a proxy, or any other intermediary.
6. **Code on demand (optional)**:  
Most of the time, a server will send back static representations of resources in the form of XML or JSON. However, when necessary, servers can send executable code to the client.
