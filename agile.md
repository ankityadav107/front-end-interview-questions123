Q. What are some potential drawbacks of using an Agile methodology?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

- Agile is simple to understand in principle but hard to do well in practice. It requires real commitment and first attempts are not likely to go very well.
- The fact that Agile requires minimal planning at the beginning makes it easy to get sidetracked delivering new, unexpected functionality.
- Agile demands more time and energy from everyone because developers and users (e.g. Product Owner) must constantly interact with each other.
- There can be less of a blueprint of what the final deliverable will be. This can make it harder to gain commitment to the project by stakeholders at the early stage.
- Agile can be challenging when there is a supplier-customer relationship. Customers typically want to know what they are getting for their money as early as possible.
- Agile can be very challenging on much larger projects or where co-location is not possible (between developers and the business).
- The agile approach often requires quick shifts from one aspect of a project to another. This may leave little time for doing the proper paperwork at each stage. Record-keeping is important, but it is often a casualty of agile working methods.
- Features that are too big to fit into one or even several cycles might be avoided because they don't fit in nicely into the philosophy.
