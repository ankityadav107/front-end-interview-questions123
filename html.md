<li>Can a webpage contain multiple &lt;h1&gt; elements?</li>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

Yes, it can. However some SEO experts suggest having only one. Some HTML validation tools will display a warning if multiple `h1` tags are present on a page.

<li>Why do we add a `Doctype` at the beginning of a HTML document?</li>

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

`DOCTYPE` or Document Type Declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. Using it ensures that the user agent correctly parses the HTML as we intended it.

HTML5: `<!DOCTYPE html>`

HTML4: `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">`
