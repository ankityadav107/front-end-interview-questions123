ğŸŒ¼ Arrays: concat()  
ğŸŒ¼ Arrays: copying & the problem with using Array 1 = Array 2  
ğŸŒ¼ Arrays: creation & initialization  
ğŸŒ¼ Arrays: create an array with an initial length of 20  
ğŸŒ¼ Arrays: every() vs. some()  
ğŸŒ¼ Arrays: fill()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The fill() method changes all elements in an array to a static value.
- fill() is a mutator method: it will change the original array and return it, not a copy of it.

```markdown
arr.fill(value, start(optional), end(optional))
```

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];

console.log(array1.fill(0, 2, 4)); //=> [1, 2, 0, 0]
console.log(array1.fill(5, 1)); //=> [1, 5, 5, 5]
console.log(array1.fill(6)); //=> [6, 6, 6, 6]
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Arrays: filter()  
ğŸŒ¼ Arrays: flat()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- It is used to flatten an array.
- It can receive an optional depth level parameter specifying how deep a nested array structure should be flattened. Defaults to 1.

```javascript
let arr1 = [1, 2, [3, 4]];
arr1.flat(); //=> [1, 2, 3, 4]

let arr2 = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]];
arr2.flat(); //=> [1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6]]

let arr3 = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]];
arr3.flat(2); //=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

let arr4 = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6, [7, 8, [9, 10]]]]];
arr4.flat(Infinity); //=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

- It can also used to remove empty slots in an array.

```javascript
let arr5 = [1, 2, , , 4, 5];
arr5.flat(); //=> [1, 2, 4, 5]
```

ğŸŒ¼ Arrays: the three methods used to perform a search in an array?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- ECMAScriptâ€™s three strict equivalence lookup methods are `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()`, available in all ECMAScript versions, and `includes()`, which was introduced in the ECMAScript 7 specification.

ğŸŒ¼ Async & Await  
ğŸŒ¼ Atomics  
ğŸŒ¼ Bitwise operators  
ğŸŒ¼ BOM (Browser Object Model)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a browser-specific convention referring to all the objects exposed by the web browser.
- Unlike the DOM, there is no standard for implementation and no strict definition, so browser vendors are free to implement the BOM in any way they wish.
- The top level of the hierarchy is the window object which represents the browser window.

ğŸŒ± Compiling vs. Transpiling  
ğŸŒ¼ console.log() vs. console.dir()  
ğŸŒ¼ Currying  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Currying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions each taking a single argument.
- For instance it can make function `f(a,b,c)` callable as `f(a)(b)(c)`.

For example,

```javascript
function multiply(a, b, c) {
  return a * b * c;
}
multiply(1,2,3); // 6
```

can be modified to its curried version as such:

```javascript
function multiply(a) {
  return (b) => {
    return (c) => {
      return a * b * c;
    }
  }
}
multiply(1)(2)(3); // 6
```

ğŸŒ¼ Falsy values

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- A falsy value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context.
- There are 8 falsy values: `false`, `0`, `-0`, `0n` (BigInt), `' '` (Empty string), `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`.

</p></details>

ğŸŒ± Feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA string  
ğŸŒ¼ for.. in vs. for.. of  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- `for.. in` iterates over all enumerable property **keys** of an object
- `for.. of` iterates over the **values** of an iterable object.

```javascript
let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (let key in arr) {
  console.log(key); //=> 0, 1, 2
}

for (let value of arr) {
  console.log(value) //=> a, b, c
}
```

ğŸŒ¼ Functions vs. methods  
ğŸŒ¼ Functions: `arguments` object  
ğŸŒ¼ Functions: arrow functions vs. classic functions (4 differences)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
1. An arrow function does not have its own this. In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever. With arrow functions the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function (lexical).
2. Arrow functions cannot be used as constructors and will throw an error when used with new.
3. Unlike regular functions, the `arguments` object is not defined for arrow functions.
4. Arrow functions do not have a prototype property.

</p></details>

ğŸŒ± Functions: `function Person(){}` vs. `var person = Person()` vs. `var person = new Person()`  
ğŸŒ¼ Functions: higher order functions  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Higher order functions take another function as an argument or return a function.
- Taking another function as an argument is often referred to as a callback function

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Functions: idempotent functions  
ğŸŒ¼ Functions: pure functions  
ğŸŒ¼ Functions: why do we say that in JavaScript, functions are first class citizens.  
ğŸŒ¼ Generator functions & yield keyword  
ğŸŒ¼ Generators  
ğŸŒ¼ Getters & Setters  
ğŸŒ¼ Hoisting  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).
  
- It allows us to use a variable before it has been declared.

- Hoisted variables are initialized to `undefined` until they are assigned a value.

- Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

- Function and Class **expressions** are not hoisted.

```javascript
console.log(a); //=> undefined
var a = 1;

console.log(b);
let b = 1;
// "ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
```

ğŸŒ¼ JavaScript vs. ECMAScript  
ğŸŒ¼ JavaScript vs. TypeScript  
ğŸŒ¼ JSON parse() vs. stringify()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- `JSON.parse()` takes a JSON string and transforms it into a JavaScript object.
- `JSON.stringify()` takes a JavaScript object and transforms it into a JSON string.

```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 23,
  favoriteFood: 'Pizza'
};

const objStr = JSON.stringify(obj);

console.log(objStr);
// "{"name":"John","age":23,"favoriteFood":"Pizza"}"

console.log(JSON.parse(objStr));
// Object {name:"John",age:23,favoriteFood:"Pizza"}
```

ğŸŒ± Nullish coalescing operator  
ğŸŒ¼ Objects: assign()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object.

```javascript
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };
const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target); //=> Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }
console.log(returnedTarget); //=> Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: assign() - A problem with using it to copy objects  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Object.assign() only does shallow copying. For deep cloning, we need to use alternatives. A common hack is to use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` as such:

```javascript
  obj1 = { a: 0 , b: { c: 0}};
  let obj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));
  console.log(JSON.stringify(obj2)); //=> { "a": 0, "b": { "c": 0}}

  obj1.a = 4;
  obj1.b.c = 4;
  console.log(JSON.stringify(obj2)); //=> { "a": 0, "b": { "c": 0}}
  ```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: cloning an object (two ways)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Both of these methods perform shallow cloning:


```javascript
const obj = {a: 1};

const copy1 = Object.assign({}, obj) ;
console.log(copy1); //=> {a: 1}

const copy2 = {...obj} ;
console.log(copy2); //=> {a: 1}
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: create()  
ğŸŒ¼ Objects: creation & initialization (two ways)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- There are two ways to explicitly create an instance of Object.
- The first is to use the new operator with the Object constructor like this:

```javascript
let person = new Object();
person.name = "Nicholas";
person.age = 29;
```

- The other way is to use object literal notation:

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Nicholas",
  age: 29
};
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: entries()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
- The Object.entries() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs.

```javascript
const obj = {
  a: 'something',
  b: 42,
};

console.log(Object.entries(obj));
//=> [['a', 'something'], ['b', 42]]

for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {
console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
//=> a: something, b: 42
}
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: freeze()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- `Object.freeze()` makes it impossible to add, remove, or modify properties of an object (unless the property's value is another object).

```javascript
const obj = {
  prop: 42
};

Object.freeze(obj);
obj.prop = 33;
console.log(obj.prop); //=> 42
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: freeze() vs. seal()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- `Object.freeze()` makes it impossible to add, remove, or modify properties of an object.
- `Object.seal()` is similar, however it does allow exiting properties to be modified.

</p></details>

ğŸŒ± Objects: freeze() vs. preventExtensions()  
ğŸŒ¼ Objects: fromEntries()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The `Object.fromEntries()` method transforms a list of key-value pairs into an object. It accepts an iterable such as Array or Map and returns a new iterable object.

```javascript
const map = new Map([ ['foo', 'bar'], ['baz', 42] ]);
const obj = Object.fromEntries(map);
console.log(obj); //=> { foo: "bar", baz: 42 }

const arr = [ ['0', 'a'], ['1', 'b'], ['2', 'c'] ];
const obj = Object.fromEntries(arr);
console.log(obj); // { 0: "a", 1: "b", 2: "c" }
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: hasOwnProperty()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The `Object.hasOwnProperty()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property (as opposed to inheriting it).

```javascript
obj = new Object();
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('prop')); // false
obj.prop = 'exists';
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('prop')); // true
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('toString')); // false
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ± Objects: host objects vs. native objects  
ğŸŒ¼ Objects: how do we determine if an object is an array?  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- By using the `Array.isArray()` method.

```javascript
if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
  // do something on the array
}
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ± Objects: immutable objects  
ğŸŒ± Objects: is everything in JavaScript considered an object?  
ğŸŒ± Objects: is()  
ğŸŒ¼ Objects: iterating over object properties  
ğŸŒ¼ Objects: the optional chaining operator `?.`

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The optional chaining operator `?.` allows us to optionally access deeper nested properties within objects without having to expressly validate that each reference in the chain is valid.  
- The `?.` operator functions similarly to the `.` chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish (`null` or `undefined`), the expression short-circuits with a return value of `undefined`. When used with function calls, it returns `undefined` if the given function does not exist.

```javascript
const adventurer = {
name: 'Alice',
cat: {
  name: 'Dinah'
}
};

const dogName = adventurer.dog?.name;
console.log(dogName); //=> undefined
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: the two ways to access an object's properties and their differences  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- In JavaScript, we have two ways to access properties on an object: bracket notation, or dot notation.
- With dot notation, JavaScript tries to find the property on the object with that exact name.
- When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket [ and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket ]. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.

```javascript
const colorConfig = {
  red: true,
  blue: false,
  green: true,
  black: true,
  yellow: false,
};

const colors = ['pink', 'red', 'blue'];
console.log(colorConfig.colors[1]); //=> TypeError (colorConfig does not have a colors property.)
```

ğŸŒ¼ Sets & methods associated with them  
ğŸŒ¼ Sets: iterating over a set  
ğŸŒ¼ Shallow vs. Deep copying  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- In shallow copying, both items point to the same memory location.
- In deep copying, the second item is assigned a separate memory location than the original item.
- In other words, in a shallow copy, object B points to object A's location in memory. In deep copy, all things in object A's memory location get copied to object B's memory location.

ğŸŒ¼ Strings: padStart() and padEnd()  
ğŸŒ¼ Strings: indexOf() vs. search()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- `indexOf()` is for searching for plain substrings. It also allows us to specify a starting index. It does not allow for regular expressions.
- `search()` allows for substrings as well as regular expressions. It does not allow for a starting index.

```javascript
console.log('Blue Whale'.indexOf('Whale', 3)); //=> 5
console.log('hey JudE'.search(/[A-Z]/g)); //=> 4
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Strings: search() vs. match()  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- `Search()` returns the index of the first match between the regular expression and the given string, or `-1` if no match was found.
- `Match()` returns an array or `null` if no matches are found.

```javascript
const str1 = 'hey JudE';
console.log(str1.search(/[A-Z]/g)); // 4

const str2 = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';
console.log(str2.match(/[A-E]/gi)); // ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
```

ğŸŒ¼ typeof operator (8 possible types)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.
- The possible return values are: `object`, `boolean`, `number`, `bigint`, `string`, `symbol`, `function`, `undefined`.

```javascript
console.log(typeof 3.14); //=> number
console.log(typeof NaN); //=> number
console.log(typeof 42n); //=> bigint
console.log(typeof 'hello'); //=> string
console.log(typeof true); //=> boolean
console.log(typeof Symbol('foo')); //=> symbol
console.log(typeof someVariable); //=> undefined
console.log(typeof [1, 2]); //=> object
console.log(typeof { a: 1 }); //=> object
console.log(typeof null); //=> object
console.log(typeof Math.min); //=> function
console.log(typeof function() {}); //=> function

ğŸŒ¼ Unary operators  
ğŸŒ¼ Unary operators: what is `~3` equal to?  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The bitwise Not operator `~` converts the integer `N` to `-(N+1)` value. Therefore `~3 = -4`.

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Unary operators: what is `~~3.9` equal to?  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Double bitwise NOT performs the same operation as the `Math.floor()` method but a lot quicker.

```javascript
~~3.9 === Math.floor(3.9); //true, 3
~~2.4 === Math.floor(2.4); //true, 2
~~2 === Math.floor(2); //true, 2
```

ğŸŒ¼ DOM: getElement(s)By* vs. querySelector(All) methods

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- All `getElement(s)By*` methods return a live HTML collection of elements. Such collections always reflect the current state of the document and auto-update when it changes.
- In contrast, `querySelector(All)` methods return a static NodeList object. Itâ€™s like a fixed array of elements. Because querySelectorAll() returns a list that is static from the moment it is called, its list of items cannot be updated thereafter even if changes are made to the DOM dynamically.

```javascript
<div>First div</div>

<script>
  let divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');
</script>

<div>Second div</div>

<script>
  alert(divs.length); //=> 2
</script>
```

```javascript
<div>First div</div>

<script>
  let divs = document.querySelectorAll('div');

ğŸŒ¼ Box-shadow  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

```css
box-shadow: (offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius(optional) | spread-radius(optional) | color(optional));
```

- `blur radius`: if set to 0 the shadow will be sharp, the higher the number, the more blurred it will be, and the further out the shadow will extend.
- `spread radius`: positive values increase the size of the shadow, negative values decrease the size. Default is 0 (the shadow is same size as blur).

```css
/* offset-x | offset-y | color */
box-shadow: 60px -16px teal;

/* offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | color */
box-shadow: 10px 5px 5px black;

/* offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | spread-radius | color */
box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);

/* inset | offset-x | offset-y | color */
box-shadow: inset 5em 1em gold;

/* Any number of shadows, separated by commas */
box-shadow: 3px 3px red, -1em 0 0.4em olive;
```

ğŸŒ¼ Box-sizing  
ğŸŒ¼ Cascading in CSS  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- Cascading is the process of combining several style sheets and resolving conflicts between them.
- The rule used is chosen by cascading down from the more general rules to the specific rule required.
- Concepts such as **inheritance** and **specificity** are used to decide which styles get applied.  

For instance,  

- a more specific rule will override a less specific rule.
- a rule defined in an external stylesheet is overruled by a style defined in the `<head>` of the document, which, in turn, is overruled by an inline style within the element itself.

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- CSS vendor prefixes, also sometimes known as or CSS browser prefixes, are a way for browser makers to add support for new CSS features before those features are fully supported in all browsers. This may be done during a sort of testing and experimentation period where the browser manufacturer is determining exactly how these new CSS features will be implemented. These prefixes became very popular with the rise of CSS3 a few years ago.
- The CSS browser prefixes that you can use (each of which is specific to a different browser) are:

```markdown
Android: -webkit-
Chrome: -webkit-
iOS: -webkit-
Safari: -webkit-
Firefox: -moz-
Internet Explorer: -ms-
Opera: -o-
```

```css
.container {
  -webkit-transition: all 4s ease;
  -moz-transition: all 4s ease;
  -ms-transition: all 4s ease;
  -o-transition: all 4s ease;
  transition: all 4s ease;
}
```

ğŸŒ¼ Preprocessor  
ğŸŒ¼ Pseudo-classes vs pseudo-elements  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
- A pseudo-class is a selector that selects existing elements that are in a specific state, e.g. hovered over, checked, focused, etc.
- Pseudo-classes start with a colon `:`
- Some common pseudo-classes are `:active`, `:checked`, `:enabled`, `:first-child`, `:first-of-type`, `:focus`, `:hover`, `:last-child`, `:last-of-type`, `:nth-of-type`, `:visited`, etc.

```css
article a:hover {
    font-size: 120%;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

- Pseudo-elements behave in a similar way, however they act as if you had added a whole new HTML element into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements.
- Pseudo-elements start with a double colon `::`
- Most common pseudo-elements are `::after`, `::before`, `::first-letter`, and `::first-line`.

```css
article p::first-line {
    font-size: 120%;
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

ğŸŒ¼ data-* attributes  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- The data-* attributes allow us to be able to make up our own HTML attributes and put our own information inside them.
- They are used to store custom data private to the page or application.
- The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience (without any Ajax calls or server-side database queries).

```html
<article
  id="electric-cars"
  data-columns="3"
  data-index-number="12314"
  data-parent="cars">
  <!-- additional content -->
</article>
```

- We can read the value of these attributes in JavaScript.

```javascript
const article = document.querySelector('#electric-cars');

article.dataset.columns // "3"
article.dataset.indexNumber // "12314"
article.dataset.parent // "cars"
```

- They can also be accessed in CSS.

```css
article[data-columns='3'] {
  width: 400px;
}
article[data-columns='4'] {
  width: 600px;
}
```

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
- The `map` tag is used to define a client-side image-map. An image-map is an image with clickable areas.
- The required name attribute of the `map` element is associated with the `usemap` attribute and creates a relationship between the image and the map.
- The `map` element contains a number of `area` elements that define the clickable areas in the image map.
- We use the `area` tag in conjunction with the shape of the clickable area [rect, circle, or poly] and coords [rect: left, top, right, bottom; circle: center-x, center-y, radius; poly: x1, y1, x2, y2, ...] attributes.

```html
<map name="primary">
  <area shape="circle" coords="75,75,75" href="left.html">
  <area shape="circle" coords="275,75,75" href="right.html">

ğŸŒ± REST vs. SOAP APIs  
ğŸŒ¼ RESTful API (6 constraints)  

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

- In order to be a true RESTful API, a web service must adhere to the following six REST architectural constraints:
  
1. **Client-Server based**:  
The client and the server should be separate from each other and allowed to evolve individually and independently.
2. **Use of a uniform interface (UI)**:  
The key to the decoupling client from server is having a uniform interface that allows independent evolution of the application without having the applicationâ€™s services, models, or actions tightly coupled to the API layer itself. The uniform interface lets the client talk to the server in a single language, independent of the architectural backend of either.
3. **Stateless operations**:  
Meaning that requests can be made independently of one another, and each request contains all of the data necessary to complete itself successfully. A REST API should not rely on data being stored on the server or sessions to determine what to do with a request, but rather solely rely on the data that is provided in that request itself. Identifying information is not being stored on the server when making requests. Instead, each request has the necessary data in itself, such as the API key, access token, user ID, etc.
4. **Caching**:  
A REST API should be designed to encourage the storage of cacheable data on the client side in order to reduce the number of interactions with the API. This means that when data is cacheable, the response should indicate that the data can be stored up to a certain time (expires-at), or in cases where data needs to be real-time, that the response should not be cached by the client.
5. **Layered system**:  
REST allows for an architecture composed of multiple layers of servers. The requesting client need not know whether itâ€™s communicating with the actual server, a proxy, or any other intermediary.
6. **Code on demand (optional)**:  
Most of the time, a server will send back static representations of resources in the form of XML or JSON. However, when necessary, servers can send executable code to the client.

ğŸŒ¼ Given an input string and an integer array indices of the same length. The input string will be shuffled such that the character at the `i`th position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string. Return the shuffled string.  

```javascript
const shuffleString = (input, indices) => {
  // ...
};

input = "abc";
indices = [0,1,2];
console.log(shuffleString(input, indices)); // "abc"

input = "aiohn";
indices = [3,1,4,2,0];
console.log(shuffleString(input, indices)); // "nihao"

input = "aaiougrt";
indices = [4,0,2,6,7,3,1,5];
console.log(shuffleString(input, indices)); // "arigatou"

input = "art";
indices = [1,0,2];
console.log(shuffleString(input, indices)); // "rat"
```

```javascript
const shuffleString = (input, indices) => {
  const shuffledString = Array(input.length);
  indices.forEach((i, ele) => (shuffledString[i] = input.charAt(ele)));
  return shuffledString.join('');
};

ğŸŒ¼ A function that determines if a string has all unique characters.  

```javascript
const isUnique = str => {
  // ...
}

console.log(isUnique('abcd')); // true
console.log(isUnique('aabcd')); // false
```

```javascript
const isUnique = str => {
  let obj = {};
  for (char of str) {
    if (obj[char]) return false;
    obj[char] = true;
  }
  return true;
}
```
