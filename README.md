<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

- It is used to flatten an array.
- It can receive an optional depth level parameter specifying how deep a nested array structure should be flattened. Defaults to 1.

```javascript
let arr1 = [1, 2, [3, 4]];
arr1.flat(); //=> [1, 2, 3, 4]

let arr2 = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]];
arr2.flat(); //=> [1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6]]

let arr3 = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]];
arr3.flat(2); //=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

let arr4 = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6, [7, 8, [9, 10]]]]];
arr4.flat(Infinity); //=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

- It can also used to remove empty slots in an array.

```javascript
let arr5 = [1, 2, , , 4, 5];
arr5.flat(); //=> [1, 2, 4, 5]
```

ECMAScriptâ€™s three strict equivalence lookup methods are `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()`, available in all ECMAScript versions, and `includes()`, which was introduced in the ECMAScript 7 specification.

ğŸŒ¼ DOM: An important difference between `getElement(s)By*` methods and `querySelector(All)` methods

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

- All `getElement(s)By*` methods return a live HTML collection of elements. Such collections always reflect the current state of the document and auto-update when it changes.
- In contrast, `querySelector(All)` methods return a static NodeList object. Itâ€™s like a fixed array of elements. Because querySelectorAll() returns a list that is static from the moment it is called, its list of items cannot be updated thereafter even if changes are made to the DOM dynamically.

```javascript
<div>First div</div>

<script>
  let divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');
</script>

<div>Second div</div>

<script>
  alert(divs.length); //=> 2
</script>
```

```javascript
<div>First div</div>

<script>
  let divs = document.querySelectorAll('div');
</script>

<div>Second div</div>

<script>
  alert(divs.length); //=> 1
</script>
```

- `for.. in` iterates over all enumerable property **keys** of an object
- `for.. of` iterates over the **values** of an iterable object.

```javascript
let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (let key in arr) {
  console.log(key); //=> 0, 1, 2

ğŸŒ¼ Hoisting  

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
- Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function). 
  
- It allows us to use a variable before it has been declared.

- Hoisted variables are initialized to `undefined` until they are assigned a value.

- Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.

- Function and Class **expressions** are not hoisted.

```javascript
console.log(a); //=> undefined
var a = 1;

console.log(b);
let b = 1;
// "ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
```

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: `assign()`  

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

- The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object.

```javascript
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };
const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target); //=> Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }
console.log(returnedTarget); //=> Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: `assign()` - A problem when using `Object.assign()` to copy objects  

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

Object.assign() only does shallow copying. For deep cloning, we need to use alternatives. A common hack is to use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` as such:

```javascript
  obj1 = { a: 0 , b: { c: 0}};
  let obj2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));
  console.log(JSON.stringify(obj2)); //=> { "a": 0, "b": { "c": 0}}

  obj1.a = 4;
  obj1.b.c = 4;
  console.log(JSON.stringify(obj2)); //=> { "a": 0, "b": { "c": 0}}
  ```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: shallow cloning an object (two ways)  

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

```javascript
const obj = {a: 1};

const copy1 = Object.assign({}, obj) ;
console.log(copy1); //=> {a: 1}

const copy2 = {...obj} ;
console.log(copy2); //=> {a: 1}
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: `create()`  
ğŸŒ¼ Objects: Creation and initialization  
ğŸŒ¼ Objects: `freeze()`  

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

- `Object.freeze()` makes it impossible to add, remove, or modify properties of an object (unless the property's value is another object).

```javascript
const obj = {
  prop: 42
};

Object.freeze(obj);
obj.prop = 33;
console.log(obj.prop); //=> 42
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: `hasOwnProperty()`  

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

- The `Object.hasOwnProperty()` method returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property (as opposed to inheriting it).

```javascript
obj = new Object();
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('prop')); // false
obj.prop = 'exists';
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('prop')); // true
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('toString')); // false
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ± Objects: host objects vs. native objects  
ğŸŒ¼ Objects: how do we determine if an object is an array?  

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

By using the `Array.isArray()` method:

```javascript
if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
  // do something on the array
}
```

ğŸŒ± Objects: `is()`  
ğŸŒ¼ Objects: iterating over object properties  
ğŸŒ¼ Objects: the optional chaining operator `?.`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

The optional chaining operator `?.` allows us to optionally access deeper nested properties within objects without having to expressly validate that each reference in the chain is valid. The `?.` operator functions similarly to the `.` chaining operator, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish (`null` or `undefined`), the expression short-circuits with a return value of `undefined`. When used with function calls, it returns `undefined` if the given function does not exist.

```javascript
const adventurer = {
name: 'Alice',
cat: {
  name: 'Dinah'
}
};

const dogName = adventurer.dog?.name;
console.log(dogName); //=> undefined
```

</p></details>

ğŸŒ¼ Objects: the two ways to access an object's properties and their differences  

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

- In JavaScript, we have two ways to access properties on an object: bracket notation, or dot notation.
- With dot notation, JavaScript tries to find the property on the object with that exact name.
- When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket [ and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket ]. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.

```javascript
const colorConfig = {
  red: true,
  blue: false,
  green: true,
  black: true,
  yellow: false,
};

const colors = ['pink', 'red', 'blue'];
console.log(colorConfig.colors[1]); //=> TypeError (colorConfig does not have a colors property.)
```

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

- In shallow copying, both items point to the same memory location.
- In deep copying, the second item is assigned a separate memory location than the original item.
- In other words, in a shallow copy, object B points to object A's location in memory. In deep copy, all things in object A's memory location get copied to object B's memory location.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

- CSS vendor prefixes, also sometimes known as or CSS browser prefixes, are a way for browser makers to add support for new CSS features before those features are fully supported in all browsers. This may be done during a sort of testing and experimentation period where the browser manufacturer is determining exactly how these new CSS features will be implemented. These prefixes became very popular with the rise of CSS3 a few years ago.
- The CSS browser prefixes that you can use (each of which is specific to a different browser) are:

```css
Android: -webkit-
Chrome: -webkit-
iOS: -webkit-
Safari: -webkit-
Firefox: -moz-
Internet Explorer: -ms-
Opera: -o-
```

```css
.container {
  -webkit-transition: all 4s ease;
  -moz-transition: all 4s ease;
  -ms-transition: all 4s ease;
  -o-transition: all 4s ease;

- The value for A (alpha) is from `0` completely transparent, to `1` completely opaque.
